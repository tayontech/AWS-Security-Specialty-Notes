## What is IAM?
IAM allows you to manage users and their level of access to the AWS console.

### What does IAM gives you?
- Centralized control of your AWS account
- Shared access to your AWS account
- Granular Permissions
- Identity Federation (including Active Directory, Facebook, LinkedIn, etc)
- Multi Factor Authentication
- Provide temporary access for users/devices and services where necessary
- Allows you to setup your own password rotation policy
- Integrates with many different AWS services
- Supports PCI DSS compliance

### IAM Best Practices
- Never use the root account to perform tasks. The root account has full administrative rights to all AWS resources.
- Enable MFA for the root account.
- Create user accounts for your administrators.
- Add users to your admin group.

## Controlling Permissions w/ IAM
[Overview of JSON policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html#access_policies-json)

IAM Policy Documents can be assigned to groups, users, and roles.

### Policy Documents Best Practices
- Do not assign policy documents to users. This becomes difficult to manage as the amount of users increase.
- You should add users to groups and assign the policy document to the group. The user then inherits the groups permissions.

### S3 Bucket Policies
S3 bucket policies are attached only to S3 buckets. S3 bucket policies specify what actions are allowed or denied to the bucket. they can be broken down to a user level. So Alice can PUT but not DELETE and John can READ but not PUT etc.

#### Use Cases
- You want a simple way to grant cross-account access to your S3 environment, without using IAM roles.
- Your IAM policies bump against the size limit (up to 2kb for users, 5 kb for groups, and 10 kb for roles). S3 supports bucket policies of up to 20 kb.
- You prefer to keep access control policies in the S3 environment.
