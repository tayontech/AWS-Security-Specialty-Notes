## What is IAM?
IAM allows you to manage users and their level of access to the AWS console.

### What does IAM gives you?
- Centralized control of your AWS account
- Shared access to your AWS account
- Granular Permissions
- Identity Federation (including Active Directory, Facebook, LinkedIn, etc)
- Multi Factor Authentication
- Provide temporary access for users/devices and services where necessary
- Allows you to setup your own password rotation policy
- Integrates with many different AWS services
- Supports PCI DSS compliance

### IAM Best Practices
- Never use the root account to perform tasks. The root account has full administrative rights to all AWS resources.
- Enable MFA for the root account.
- Create user accounts for your administrators.
- Add users to your admin group.

## Controlling Permissions w/ IAM
[Overview of JSON policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html#access_policies-json)

IAM Policy Documents can be assigned to groups, users, and roles.

### Policy Documents Best Practices
- Do not assign policy documents to users. This becomes difficult to manage as the amount of users increase.
- You should add users to groups and assign the policy document to the group. The user then inherits the groups permissions.

### S3 Bucket Policies
S3 bucket policies are attached only to S3 buckets. S3 bucket policies specify what actions are allowed or denied to the bucket. they can be broken down to a user level. So Alice can PUT but not DELETE and John can READ but not PUT etc.

#### Use Cases
- You want a simple way to grant cross-account access to your S3 environment, without using IAM roles.
- Your IAM policies bump against the size limit (up to 2kb for users, 5 kb for groups, and 10 kb for roles). S3 supports bucket policies of up to 20 kb.
- You prefer to keep access control policies in the S3 environment.

### S3 ACL's
S3 ACLs are a legacy access control mechanism that predates IAM. AWS recommend utilizing IAM and S3 bucket policies. However, if you need to apply policies on the objects themselves, then use S3 ACL's. Bucket policies can only be applied at the bucket level where as S3 ACL's can be applied to individual files(objects).

### Conflicting Policies (Huge Exam Topic)
With least privilege, decisions ALWAYS default to DENY.
Also an explicit DENY ALWAYS trumps and ALLOW.
So if you DENY access to something somewhere and then something else allows access, the DENY will always override the ALLOW.

Ex.
If an IAM policy grants access to an object, the S3 bucket policies denies access to that object, and there is no S3 ACL, then access will be denied.

Only if no method specifies a DENY and one or more methods specify an ALLOW will the request be allowed.
